# _Madame Sosotris Tarot Reader_

#### _A progressive web application for tarot drawings 11-14-2018_

#### By _**William Kulha**_

## Description

_A 'week-long' (read: several-weeks-long) project for learnhowtoprogram.com. This progressive web application / website allows users to get tarot readings._\
_At the moment there are three different spreads to choose from, and only the Rider-Waite deck (because it's in the public domain). The links for more information all lead to Biddy Tarot, but they also have onscreen keyword displays and short descriptions._\
_Cards have a 50/50 chance of being drawn right-side-up or upside-down. Currently this feature cannot be disabled._\
_If people like using Madame Sosotris, I wouldn't be opposed to adding more spreads, more sources._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download or clone this repo <code>$git clone https://github.com/zangiboy/tarot</code>_
* _Navigate to the folder where you saved the directory._
* _Open with the browser of your choice and enjoy_
*_Alternatively, you can just navigate [Here](https://zangiboy.github.io/tarot/) to use the site_
*_If you plan on using it as a progressive web app, I strongly recommend downloading it over wifi, as the card image files make the whole package more than 30Mb._

## Planned Future Features

_Adding additional spreads_\
_Responsive design for proper display on desktop computers_

## Known Bugs

_Responsive design hasn't been implemented to ensure proper displays at screen sizes larger than an iPad._
